"WTF FLOW MODE RELEASED I NEED TEST ON THEM AND SEND BUGS TO THE DISCORD SERVER PLEASE
DID I FIX THE CAPTCHA PAUSE OR ISONBREAK THING SMH?
JOIN AND TELL ME THE BUGS PLEASE FOR YOUR SAKE OF BOTTING BRUH"
# Simplified Notifications! (Chat GPT)
It seems like you're frustrated because Flow Mode has been released, and you want to test it and report any bugs to the Discord server. You're particularly concerned about whether you fixed the issue with the captcha pause or the "isonbreak" problem. You're urging someone (perhaps me) to join the Discord server and help identify and report any bugs, emphasizing the importance of doing so for the sake of botting.

# Desperations
Request is out of date and deprecated, I know, but I still use it. Any problems?

# STAR
Hey, visitors? Consider giving me a star and helping for devs? A big W for you!
After v3.0.1 was released, I can go to sleep now. Thank you so much, dudes, for helping me along the way.

# Donkzz
Advanced Dank Memer self-bot! Supports slash commands, incredibly strong, reliable, and easy to use.

# Instructions
Fill in the information in config.json and tokens.txt as in the file.
Run the bot and have it ready for you.
To use the auto buy function, you must open the Shop View embed and select the menu to Coin Shop. Otherwise, the bot won't work correctly!

This bot is forked and rewritten from [TahaGorme/donkzz](https://github.com/TahaGorme/slashy) Give them some credit.
Also, this bot has added many functions from the old version, like supporting work minigames, auto-join global DMC giveaways, auto-scratch, and support for webhooks!
For Replit hosting and custom website, as I'm not good at doing HTML stuff (with the outdated website from the original version) and Replit only supports up to NodeJS v18, Donkzz can't be hosted on Replits, as it can cause RAM overloads and big lag spikes. Since then, I've removed the website and made it self-hosting only. Will have more changes in the future.
Instructions can be found in the repository of the original one (Donkzz). Thanks for taking a look at this.
Support server (I need help from coding :D ): Support Server. Enjoy!
